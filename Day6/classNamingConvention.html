  <!-- this is the classe's naming convention that we can use to get rid of nesting and to also understand our css code better-->
  <div class="cards--parent">

    <div class="card card--light"><!-- we can write one common class name for 2 same kind of divs and 2nd class as 
    modifier which can modify any of them according to needs, we can use (--) for modifier class name-->

      <img src="" alt="" class="card__image"><!--Also the (--) defines that it is a modifier class name and is written with parent div
       and to differtiate parent with child elemnts by class name , we can define child class names with (__) so we can 
       clearly identify that which elemnt is child and which is parent-->
